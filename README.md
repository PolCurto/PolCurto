## üëã Hi, I'm Pol Curto 
I'm a Software Engineer experienced in C++, C#, and software architecture, with a strong background in videogame development and general software engineering. I enjoy designing efficient systems, solving complex problems, and working on projects that combine creativity with solid technical foundations. My professional experience includes working the Unity Game Engine, and front-end development with the Angular framework using TypeScript.

I'm currently at the final stages of a master's degree in AAA videogame programming in the UPC, where we are developing a custom engine and a game on top of it. I also have a Multimedia Engineering degree in La Salle, where I learnt about a whole lot of other technologies and languages like Java, SQL, C, Docker, PHP, etc.

I'm really passionate about software development and I always try to have some personal projects going on. Currently, I'm working on a [Terraria-style game](https://github.com/PolCurto/terrario) built entirely from scratch in C++ with SDL, focusing on custom systems like world generation, tile rendering, inventory management, etc.
