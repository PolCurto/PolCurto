## üëã Hi, I'm Pol Curto 
I'm a videogame programmer experienced in working with C++, having developed a custom engine from scratch. I have also professional experience using Unity, and have used other popular game engines like Godot and Unreal. My background extends beyond games, including experience in software and web development

I'm currently at the final stages of a master's degree in AAA videogame programming in the UPC, where we are developing a custom engine and a game on top of it. I also have a Multimedia Engineering degree in La Salle.

I'm really passionate about game development and I always try to have some personal projects going on. Currently, I'm working on a [Terraria-style game](https://github.com/PolCurto/terrario) built entirely from scratch in C++ with SDL, focusing on custom systems like world generation, tile rendering, inventory management, etc.
